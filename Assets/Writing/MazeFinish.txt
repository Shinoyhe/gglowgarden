You take up the orb once again, tasting even better than the last time. A burst of summer. 
The breeze of a beach, a dip into a cold pool.
the warm embrace of the sun that once awoke you on this strange island, a hug from a friend… 
That’s just the squid actually.
[Name,Bill] YOU DID SO GOOD!!!!!!!11!!!1!1!!!! What now :3?
After eating the second ggl-orb you feel especially sluggish
[Name, Bill] U R lookin tired, we should get you under some shade :(
Perhaps returning to the tree where you started would be a good idea.
