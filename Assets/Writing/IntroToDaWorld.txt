WASD to move. Press space or f to interact. Good luck :)
You awaken in an unfamiliar place, laying down protected by the shade of a tree. 
You look out into the vastness of the space around you with this floating island being the only semblance of life. 
Your stomach growls, you must have been asleep for a long time. 
The tree bears no fruit, but in the distance you spot another creature on the island. 
A squid. They may have answers for you.
