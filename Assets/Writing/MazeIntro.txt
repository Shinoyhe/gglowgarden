You approach the new rune, it is seemingly inscribed with a maze. You should call out for-
[Name,Bill] <i> Psst, hey ;3 nice rune ya got there. Need some help with it? </i>
They hover over the rune again, and a maze next to the rune illuminates. However, it is small, there is no way you can fit in there…
[Name,Bill] I can help you fit in there :D!
They put one of their tentacles on your shoulder as you shrink.
[Name,Bill] There ya go! Now you’ll be able to traverse it in no time! Wait………….. I should’ve let you… I shoulda let you get an overhead view of it while you were big………….. OOPS good luck! :O
