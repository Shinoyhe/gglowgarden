Another rune, this one inscribed with a maze. 
You see Bill standing next to a small structure on the ground, you-
[Name,Bill] <i> Psst, hey ;3 nice rune ya got there. Need some help with it? </i>
[Name,Bill]Ooooooooh.......... this one's tricky kitty cat :o
[Name,Bill] Looks like there's 7 fragments of a ggl-orb in there.
[Name,Bill] Gather them and I can put them back together!
They focus their eyes again, and the structure illuminates.
However, it is small, there is no way you can fit in there…
[Name,Bill] I can help you fit in there :D!
They put one of their tentacles on your shoulder as you shrink.
[Name,Bill] There ya go! Now you’ll be able to traverse it in no time! Wait…………..
[Name,Bill] I should’ve let you… I shoulda let you get an overhead view of it while you were big………….. 
[Name,Bill] OOPS good luck! :O
